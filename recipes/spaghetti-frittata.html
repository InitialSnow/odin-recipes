        <h1>Welcome to the Spaghetti Frittata Recipe!</h1>
        <img src="../images/spaghetti-frittata.png">
        <p>Spaghetti Frittata is a typical dish in the Southern Italian tradition. Though of ancient origins, it perfectly matches the modern anti-waste philosophy and it is the ideal solution for leftovers from the night before. However, the Spaghetti Frittata is so good that it can also be prepared for different occasions of the year, especially during the Holiday Season.</p>
        <p>The recipe is easy and quick, but you might be asking yourself how do you cook both sides of the pasta? Our best advice: treat it like an egg omelet! Grab a lid or a large plate, turn the pan over and transfer the omelette to the plate, quickly sliding the omelette back into the pan to cook for another 10 minutes over low heat until golden brown. Make sure it doesn’t stick to the pan by moving the pan from time to time.</p>
